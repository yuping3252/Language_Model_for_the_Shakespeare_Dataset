# # Programming Assignment

# ## Language model for the Shakespeare dataset

# ### Instructions
# 
# In this notebook, you will use the text preprocessing tools and RNN models to build a character-level language model. You will then train your model on the works of Shakespeare, and use the network to generate your own text..
# 
# Some code cells are provided you in the notebook. You should avoid editing provided code, and make sure to execute the cells in order to avoid unexpected errors. Some cells begin with the line: 
# 
# `#### GRADED CELL ####`
# 
# Don't move or edit this first line - this is what the automatic grader looks for to recognise graded cells. These cells require you to write your own code to complete them, and are automatically graded when you submit the notebook. Don't edit the function name or signature provided in these cells, otherwise the automatic grader might not function properly. Inside these graded cells, you can use any functions or classes that are imported below, but make sure you don't use any variables that are outside the scope of the function.
# 
# ### How to submit
# 
# Complete all the tasks you are asked for in the worksheet. When you have finished and are happy with your code, press the **Submit Assignment** button at the top of this notebook.
# 
# ### Let's get started!
# 
# We'll start running some imports, and loading the dataset. Do not edit the existing imports in the following cell. If you would like to make further Tensorflow imports, you should add them here.

# In[3]:


#### PACKAGE IMPORTS ####

# Run this cell first to import all required packages. Do not make any imports elsewhere in the notebook

import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import json
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')

# If you would like to make further imports from tensorflow, add them here

# 
# #### The Shakespeare dataset
# 
# In this assignment, you will use a subset of the [Shakespeare dataset](http://shakespeare.mit.edu). It consists of a single text file with several excerpts concatenated together. The data is in raw text form, and so far has not yet had any preprocessing. 
# 
# Your goal is to construct an unsupervised character-level sequence model that can generate text according to a distribution learned from the dataset.

# #### Load and inspect the dataset

# In[4]:


# Load the text file into a string

with open('data/Shakespeare.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    text = file.read()


# In[5]:


# Create a list of chunks of text

text_chunks = text.split('.')


# To give you a feel for what the text looks like, we will print a few chunks from the list.

# In[6]:


# Display some randomly selected text samples

num_samples = 5
inx = np.random.choice(len(text_chunks), num_samples, replace=False)
for chunk in np.array(text_chunks)[inx]:
    print(chunk)


# #### Create a character-level tokenizer

# You should now write a function that returns a `Tokenizer` object. The function takes a list of strings as an argument, and should create a `Tokenizer` according to the following specification:
# 
# * The number of tokens should be unlimited (there should be as many as required by the dataset).
# * Tokens should be created at the character level (not at the word level, which is the default behaviour).
# * No characters should be filtered out or ignored.
# * The original capitalization should be retained (do not convert the text to lower case)
# 
# The `Tokenizer` should be fit to the `list_of_strings` argument and returned by the function. 
# 
# **Hint:** you may need to refer to the [documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/text/Tokenizer) for the `Tokenizer`.

# In[8]:


# Get the tokenizer

tokenizer = create_character_tokenizer(text_chunks)


# #### Tokenize the text
# 
# You should now write a function to use the tokenizer to map each string in `text_chunks` to its corresponding encoded sequence. The following function takes a fitted `Tokenizer` object in the first argument (as returned by `create_character_tokenizer`) and a list of strings in the second argument. The function should return a list of lists, where each sublist is a sequence of integer tokens encoding the text sequences according to the mapping stored in the tokenizer.

# #### Pad the encoded sequences and store them in a numpy array

# Since not all of the text chunks are the same length, you will need to pad them in order to train on batches. You should now complete the following function, which takes the list of lists of tokens, and creates a single numpy array with the token sequences in the rows, according to the following specification:
# 
# * The longest allowed sequence should be 500 tokens. Any sequence that is longer should be shortened by truncating the beginning of the sequence.
# * Use zeros for padding the sequences. The zero padding should be placed before the sequences as required.
# 
# The function should then return the resulting numpy array.
# 
# **Hint:** you may want to refer to the [documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/sequence/pad_sequences) for the `pad_sequences` function.

# #### Create model inputs and targets
# 
# Now you are ready to build your RNN model. The model will receive a sequence of characters and predict the next character in the sequence. At training time, the model can be passed an input sequence, with the target sequence is shifted by one.
# 
# For example, the expression `To be or not to be` appears in Shakespeare's play 'Hamlet'. Given input `To be or not to b`, the correct prediction is `o be or not to be`. Notice that the prediction is the same length as the input!

# * The function should return an input array and an output array, both of size `(num_examples, max_seq_len - 1)`.
# * The input array should contain the first `max_seq_len - 1` tokens of each sequence. 
# * The output array should contain the last `max_seq_len - 1` tokens of each sequence.

# * The first layer should be an Embedding layer with an embedding dimension of 256 and set the vocabulary size to `vocab_size` from the function argument.
# * The Embedding layer should also mask the zero padding in the input sequences.
# * The Embedding layer should also set the `batch_input_shape` to `(batch_size, None)` (a fixed batch size is required for stateful RNNs).
# * The next layer should be a (uni-directional) GRU layer with 1024 units, set to be a stateful RNN layer.
# * The GRU layer should return the full sequence, instead of just the output state at the final time step.

# #### Write a text generation algorithm

# An algorithm to generate text is as follows:
# 
# 1. Specify a seed string (e.g. `'ROMEO:'`) to get the network started, and a define number of characters for the model to generate, `num_generation_steps`.
# 2. Tokenize this sentence to obtain a list containing one list of the integer tokens.
# 3. Reset the initial state of the network. 
# 4. Convert the token list into a Tensor (or numpy array) and pass it to your model as a batch of size one.
# 5. Get the model prediction (logits) for the last time step and extract the state of the recurrent layer.
# 6. Use the logits to construct a categorical distribution and sample a token from it.
# 7. Repeat the following for `num_generation_steps - 1` steps:
# 
#     1. Use the saved state of the recurrent layer and the last sampled token to get new logit predictions
#     2. Use the logits to construct a new categorical distribution and sample a token from it.
#     3. Save the updated state of the recurrent layer.    
# 
# 8. Take the final list of tokens and convert to text using the Tokenizer.
# 
# Note that the internal state of the recurrent layer can be accessed using the `states` property. For the GRU layer, it is a list of one variable:

# In[27]:


# Inspect the model's current recurrent state

# We will break the algorithm down into two steps. First, you should now complete the following function that takes a sequence of tokens of any length and returns the model's prediction (the logits) for the last time step. The specification is as follows:
# 
# * The token sequence will be a python list, containing one list of integer tokens, e.g. `[[1, 2, 3, 4]]`
# * The function should convert the list into a 2D Tensor or numpy array
# * If the function argument `initial_state` is `None`, then the function should reset the state of the recurrent layer to zeros.
# * Otherwise, if the function argument `initial_state` is a 2D Tensor or numpy array, assign the value of the internal state of the GRU layer to this argument.
# * Get the model's prediction (logits) for the last time step only.
# 
# The function should then return the logits as a 2D numpy array, where the first dimension is equal to 1 (batch size).
# 
# **Hint:** the internal state of the recurrent can be reset to zeros using the `reset_states` method.
